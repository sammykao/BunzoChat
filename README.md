<br> BUNZO CHAT <br>


Hi! This is a creative project for my Japanese Literature class. Essentially, it is an AI Chatbot designed to act as Utsumi Bunzo from the story 'The Drifting Cloud'. 
More importantly, this project uses the Chat-GPT-3.5k API, as well as FAISS for vector embeddings in order to provide context for the model. The back end is primarily
represented using Langchain, and the front end is made with Gradio. It is hosted on huggingface at https://huggingface.co/spaces/kaosammy/Bunzo
